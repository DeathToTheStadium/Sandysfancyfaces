SANDYS THEME DOCUMENTATION
====================

So i built this theme for my client Sandys fancys faces 
with a simple goal in mind develop a website that can provide
easy navigation as well as easy ability to update so i deceided to 
go with a wordpress theme i was originally going to use a free theme 
to speed up the process of making the site so i can deliver faster but
then i realize that there was no good options as far as representing 
my clients brand so i ended up coding a custom theme

in this theme there are 5 pages 
* Home 
    * three Sections 
* About
    * one Sections 
* Services
    * three Sections 
* Events
    *  One Section
